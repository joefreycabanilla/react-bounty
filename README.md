yarn build

## Notes

---

- For faster coding, I used an existing template and modified it based on the requirements
- Since there's only one page shown in the wireframe, I decided to use react-scroll instead of react-router. I can implement react-router if required.
- Image and logo sourcing is placed in footer

## Coding Journey

---

1. Clone Tailwind VPN landing page template
2. Convert to typescript
3. Changed logos, icons, and images
4. Edit based on the exam requirements


## Todo

---

- Implement carousel
